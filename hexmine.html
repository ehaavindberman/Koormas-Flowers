    A quick tutorial: to start the game, left-click on any space. From here, each space will show the number of flowers adjacent to it. To remind yourself where flowers are, you can right-click (or ctrl+click for our Mac-user friends) on their location so that you will not left-click on them in future moves. To finish the game, uncover all of the spaces except for the flowers! You may move your view relative to the board by left-clicking and dragging. Each new season, new flowers and other vegeation grow and the board size increases. Collect as many flowers as you can!
