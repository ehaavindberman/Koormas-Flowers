    Hello and welcome, new apprentice to Koorma the turtle! Let me be first to say congratulations on the new position, there were many qualified candidates and you stood out from the pack. Now, as you stated in your cover letter, you've always wanted to travel the world and have also enjoyed gardening for some time now. That's precisely what you'll be doing here as an apprentice gardener on Koorma's shell!
  </p>
  <br>
  <p class="description">
    As you can see below, before you is an untamed wilderness of dark green unknown vegetation. Among this vegetation, though, are a number of Middlemist Red flowers. These, rarest of flowers, only grow in China and on Koorma's back. These flowers are both delicate and aromatic. From the space you start on, you will be able to smell how many are around you, but be cautious! If you touch these flowers without the right-click of your mouse, they will wither, as they are not big fans of the left-click. Gather (by either right-clicking or leaving alone) as many of these flowers as you can for glory, profit, and sustinance for Koorma!
  </p>
  <br>
  <p class="description">
    Since you're new here, we'll start with Koorma swimming low, so there are only a few Middlemist Reds present, but each time you find them all, Koorma will swim a little higher and expose more area for you to explore!
  </p>

    A quick tutorial: to start the game, left-click on any space (don't worry you won't hurt any flowers on your first guess). From here, each space will show the number of flowers adjacent to it. To remind yourself where flowers are, you can right-click (or ctrl+click for our Mac-user friends) on their location so that you will not left-click on them in future moves. To finish the game, uncover all of the spaces except for the flowers! You may move your view relative to Koorma by left-clicking and dragging. Each new season, new flowers and other vegeation grow and Koorma swims a bit further out of the water. Collect as many flowers as you can!

    Some people argue that games are all about their mechanics. I think with this example in particular, we can see that much of a game is about framing. Minesweeper vs Koorma's Flowers. The mechanics are almost identical but the framing is such that Minesweeper is a gamble for your life and Koorma's Flowers gives relaxing incentives for the same goal.

    I have played a lot of minesweeper in my day. Just in the last few months I have logged more than 2,000 games at the app that I use's "intermediate" difficulty (16x16 with 40 mines). I used to play exclusively "advanced" (16x30 with 99 mines), but was frustrated that I was often losing to random chance. I frequently think of a review written for this app in the app store that went something like, "this game starts with logic, and then when that runs out, the fun begins!" I abhor that statement. I like getting good at something, and I much prefer to only lose if I make a mistake rather than to random chance. Thus, moving from advanced (where I had an approximately 27% win rate) to intermediate (where I have an approximately 78% win rate) was actually beneficial even if the difficulty as defined by the game was less. The reality is, the game doesn't have to be like this. In the app that I use, one can create custom games with any number of mines and dimensions. When you do this, the app does not track your win rate, your average or best speeds, or games played. I decided to crank up the dimensions as far as I can (up to 24x30) and play with the mines until I found a point where I felt challenged (this happened around 250 mines, or 35% of spaces being mines, up from 20% in the "advanced" difficulty). I have yet to win a game. This does not bother me, though, because no scores are being kept and each new board challenges me to use my knowledge to get as far as I can. These games feel cosy and getting anywhere requires significant knowledge of how minesweeper works. I have also shifted away from the classic look of minesweeper, and have been using a wonderful STYLE where flying whales are behind clouds and you don't want to bother them (clouds are unknowns, whales are mines). I have found this to be the most relaxing and rewarding of the minesweeper that I have played, all because of the framing. I had to work within the app that I use to get to this point, but I hope that what I have built works similarly. More discussion to come.
