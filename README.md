# Koormas-Flowers
Hexagonal minesweeper game which I first designed in 2017 and have not updated since 2018.

This is a barebones design for a hexagonal minesweeper game using JavaScript to interact with an HTML canvas object where the game is played.

The architecture is structured with Model-View-Controller (MVC).

An example image of the game:
